# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
In this project, we look into the machine learning-based approach to sentiment analysis. We made our own training dataset and labelled it using Flair pre-trained model. Keras and TensorFlow were used to build the machine learning model. The model had an accuracy score of  ‘0.98’ and a validation accuracy score of ‘0.75’.
